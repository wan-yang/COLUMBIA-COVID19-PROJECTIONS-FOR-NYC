## Projections for the Omicron pandemic wave in NYC
### Generated on 12/30/21 using data as of 12/30/21

### These projections were generated using the best performing model settings/assumptions as follows:
- Percentage of Omicron among cases at end of week of 11/21/21: 2-6%
- Level of immune erosion: ~83%
- Increase in transmissibility: 37% (95% CI: 21 – 60%) higher than Delta; 100% (95% CI: 75 – 140%) higher than wildtype (per Yang & Shaman 2021)
- Severity: 40% of the rates for Delta for all ages
- a few other things...

### Files and format:
- The first tab (“most.likely”) shows the projections under the mostly like scenario (based on model fit to recent data). 
- The 2nd tab (“likely”) shows additional likely projections (because of uncertainty). 
- The columns show different measures (cases, deaths, and hospitalizations), weeks, and projections (v.median = median projection, iqr.lwr / iqr.upr = lower / upper bound of interquartile range;  ci95.lwr / ci.95.upr = lower / upper bound of 95% CI). 

###  Caution: Large uncerntainty due to:
- Limited number of observations (3-4 weeks) for model evaluation 
- Uptake and vaccination rate of boosters are projected per trends in recent weeks -> may overestimate numbers of people booster- vaccinated, in turn underestimate hospitalizations/mortality

### Please help the city mitigate the Omicron surge
- Stay home if you can
- Wear good-quality masks when outside
- Get your vaccination/boosters as soon as possible

### Stay safe and healthy!
